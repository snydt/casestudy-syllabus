## Responsible Use of Algorithms in the Public Sector: Case Study of the English 2020 A-level exam result

Course designed and taught by Soizic Pénicaud at Sciences Po Paris' School of Public Affairs in September-December 2021.

## Course objectives

1.Argue around issues regarding public-sector ADMS: when to deploy automated-decision making
systems in the public sector (often called “algorithms”)? What specific issues arise when dealing
with public sector algorithms? How to ensure their efficacy and monitor their actual impact,
especially with regards to inequalities? How may civil society push back against them and how to
create fruitful dialog with other actors?
\
2.Evaluate and/or pilot the design, implementation and monitoring of public sector ADMs in real
professional situations.
\
3.Know how to work in groups and produce (some of) the following type of content: policy memos,
meeting reports, algorithmic impact assessment methods, public consultation templates, civil
society campaigns, political speeches.

::: tip Nota

This class was designed for a case study format, with many interactive exercises and group assignments (course objective #3). The assignments were not included on this website, which mainly lists the readings assigned for class.

|Session|Objective in a nutshell|
|Building trust and consensus around the goal of automated decision-making systems|Understand the details of the case <br> Understand the (political, societal) choices behind automated decision-making systems <br>|
|Nota|After session 1, we assume an ADMS is going to be implemented (as if often the case in the public sector)|
|Assessing the risks and impacts of an automated decision-making system|What is "fairness"? <br> What are its limitations as a concept? <br> How can it be be ensured throughout the entire process?|
|Ensuring the technical efficacy of an automated decision-making system|Delving into the technical aspects of AMDS <br> Understanding why the technical is still political|
|Setting up feedback loops: transparency, appeals processes|Focusing more particularly on appeals & transparency after the ADMS is implemented|
|“Fck the algorithm”: backlash against ADMS|Fighting against public sector algorithms (from outside government)|
|Managing the aftermath of an “algorithmic” scandal|How governments can deal with the aftermath: do's and dont's|

## Course objectives

1.**Argue around issues regarding public-sector ADMS:** when to deploy automated-decision making
systems in the public sector (often called “algorithms”)? What specific issues arise when dealing
with public sector algorithms? How to ensure their efficacy and monitor their actual impact,
especially with regards to inequalities? How may civil society push back against them and how to
create fruitful dialog with other actors?
\
\
2.**Evaluate and/or pilot the design, implementation and monitoring** of public sector ADMS in real
professional situations.
\
\
3.**Know how to work in groups and produce (some of) the following types of content:** policy memos,
meeting reports, algorithmic impact assessment methods, public consultation templates, civil
society campaigns, political speeches.

_Nota: this class was designed for a case study format, with many interactive exercises and group assignments (course objective #3). The assignments were not included on this webpage._

## Course structure

|----|----|
|**Session**|**Objective in a nutshell**|
|1.Building trust and consensus around the goal of automated decision-making systems|Understand the details of the case <br> Understand the (political, societal) choices behind automated decision-making systems <br>|
|_Nota_|_After session 1, we assume an ADMS is going to be implemented (as if often the case in the public sector)_|
|2.Assessing the risks and impacts of an automated decision-making system|What is "fairness"? <br> What are its limitations as a concept? <br> How can it be be ensured throughout the entire process?|
|3.Ensuring the technical efficacy of an automated decision-making system|Delving into the technical aspects of AMDS <br> Understanding why the technical is still political|
|4.Setting up feedback loops: transparency, appeals processes|Focusing more particularly on appeals & transparency after the ADMS is implemented|
|5.“Fck the algorithm”: backlash against ADMS|Fighting against public sector algorithms (from outside government)|
|Managing the aftermath of an “algorithmic” scandal|How governments can deal with the aftermath: do's and dont's|
